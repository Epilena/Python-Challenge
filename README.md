# Python-Challenge

Introduction
The project consists of two different programming projects.  This is beginning stages of learning python programming without assistance of pandas.  The first data set is a simple financial record to be analyzed.  The data set is two columns DATE and PROFIT/LOSSES.  The data was analyzed to determine total number of months, the new total of profit/losses, the changes over the entire period, and the months with the greatest increase in profit and decrease in profits.  The data is then printed to the terminal and a text file.  

The second data set analyzed is election data for a small, rural town.  This data set consisted of three columns and coding was processed to analyze the votes.  Total number of votes that were cast, a list of the candidates, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election.  The analysis is then printed to the terminal and a text file.  

Data
As mentioned earlier data is simple yet useful for the learning process.  They are not highly decriptive or extensive data sets.  

Methodology
Python via VS code was utilized to accomplish the project.  Pandas was not utilized in this learning step, to practice concepts in core form.  

Results/Conclusion
The challenge helped to reiterate concepts learned in class.  The most difficult aspect of the project was solidfication of For Loops so that code was not hard coded for results.  This was first time writing to a text file and some difficulties were encountered in that process.
